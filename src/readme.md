The purpose of lorem ipsum is to create a
natural looking block of text (sentence,
paragraph, page, etc.) that doesn't distract
from THE layout. A practice not without
controversy, laying out pages with 
meaningless filler text can be very useful 
when THE focus is meant to be on design, not
content.
The passage experienced a surge in popularity
during THE 1960s when Letraset used it on
THEir dry-transfer sheets, and again during
THE 90s as desktop publishers bundled THE
text with THEir software. Today it's seen all
around THE web; on templates, websites, and
stock designs. Use our generator to get your

of lorem ipsum.
